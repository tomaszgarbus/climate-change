\section{Lecture 5: Snowball Earth}

\textbf{We don't know if it actually happened.}

Scientists agree there was a major change in Earth's climate. Disputes concern
how major.

\subsection{Carbon isotope fractionation}

Bacteria take the lighter isotope $^{12}$C out of water and preferentially
leave out $^{13}$C.

"Default" value for $\delta^{13}$C is -6 (when no factors affect it).
Values of $\delta^{13}$C equal or below -6 mean there is no life at all.

When organic material intakes $^{12}$C, the $\delta^{13}$C in the surrounding
water increases.

\subsection{Port Askaig Tillite Formation, Islay}

\textit{...the material of which the mass is composed have in time, deeper than
we have hitherto suspected, been transported by the agency of ice.} - James
Thomson, F.G.S. 1871 on the stratified rocks of Islay

\subsection{Sturtian (718-658 Myr) and Marinoan (650-635 Myr)}

Similar glaciar rocks as found by Thomson were found everywhere, not only
on Islay. This is surprising because what would glaciar rocks do e.g. in
Australia?

Austrailia}

\textbf{isr√§fflor} - scratches on rocks done by glaciers.

\textbf{Mawson (1949): Elatina Formation, Australia}

\textit{Records of severe glaciation in the late Precambrian are fast
accumulating. So far as can at present be judged, frequent and widespread
refrigerations were a feature of at least middle to late Proterozoic time.
Glaciation is evidenced to the Equators itself.

So how do we get the glaciers at the equator?

How about \textbf{axial tilt?} It would need to be bigger than $54 \degree$
for the equator to be cooler than the poles. And it wouldn't explain why it
happened twice.

\subsection{Ghaub Formation, Namibia}

\textbf{Till}\footnote{
Till or glacial till is unsorted glacial sediment.

Till is derived from the erosion and entrainment of material by the moving
ice of a glacier. It is deposited some distance down-ice to form terminal,
lateral, medial and ground moraines.

Till is classified into primary deposits, laid down directly by glaciers,
and secondary deposits, reworked by fluvial transport and other processes.

\textbf{Cap carbonate}\footnote{
Cap carbonates are layers of distinctively textured carbonate rocks
(either limestone or dolomite) that occur at the uppermost layer of
sedimentary sequences reflecting major glaciations in the geological record.
}

\subsection{Snowball Earth hypothesis}

Kirschvink (1992) first made the hypothesis but Hoffman popularized it.

Continents in the tropics (with no vegetation because it hadn't evolved yet)
$\rightarrow$
Higher albedo (desert with no vegetation has higher albedo than ocean water)

Mountain building in the tropics $\rightarrow$ Faster weathering

Higher albedo + Faster weathering $\rightarrow$ Earth becomes \textbf{much}
cooler $\rightarrow$ glaciation in the tropics $\rightarrow$ \textbf{even}
higher albedo $\rightarrow$ \textbf{even} faster cooling
$\rightarrow$ Snowball Earth

CO$_2$ from volcanoes $\rightarrow$ increased GH effect

Ash particles from volcanoes $\rightarrow$ Lower albedo

Lower albedo + increased GH effect $\rightarrow$ Earth becomes \textbf{much}
warmer $\rightarrow$ Ice melts $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Even} lower albedo
$\rightarrow$ Ice melts \textbf{faster} $\rightarrow$ Extreme GH

\subsection{Solar radiation}

$T = (E/\delta)^{1/4}$

$E = 342 W.m^{-2}$

$\delta = 5.670367 \times 10^{-8} W.m^{-2}.K^{-4}$

$T = 6\degree$C

Earth's albedo is $\alpha = 30$\% which equals $103W.m^{-2}$

Then the energy left gives $-18\degree$C. GHG contribute $+32\degree$C

\subsection{Solar radiation (716 Myr ago = Onset of Snowball Earth)}

Albedo between 50-95\%. Volcanic ash on ice sheets decreases the albedo.

$E = 160 W.m^{-2}$

$T = -43 \degree$

\subsection{Greenhouse effect (658 Myr = End of Snowball Earth)}

We're looking for how much CO$_2$ would be needed in the atmosphere to exit
the Snowball Earth. Currently (pre-industrial) at 280 ppm the GHG contribute
$32 \degree$ to global temperature.

$\Delta T = 4.3 \ln (C/C_0)$

For 1000 ppm: $\Delta T = 4.3 \ln (1000/280) = 5.5 \degree$

For 10000 ppm: $\Delta T = 4.3 \ln (10000/280) = 15.4 \degree$

For 100000 ppm: $\Delta T = 4.3 \ln (100000/280) = 25.27 \degree$

$T = -11 \degree + 25.c \degree = 14.3 \degree$ at 100000 ppm (10\%
CO$_2$ in the atmosphere)

\subsection{Cap carbonate}

Ca + Mg + CO$_2$ $\rightarrow$ CaMg(CO$_3$)$_2$

\subsection{Iron formations}

Fe + O$_2$ $\rightarrow$ Fe$_2$O$_3$
